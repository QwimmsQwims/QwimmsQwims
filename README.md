### What is Qwims? 

Qwims is a secondary token, with the purpose of raising funds, for the creation of a more solid Official Token and the creation of a particular pixel page.

There will be 100,000,000 tokens in total, where [**70%**]() of the tokens will be for the community and [**30%**]() for the collection.

### What will come in the new cryptocurrency? 

At the moment we are still developing it, very soon we will be publishing all the information about this new token, on an official page.

### What does it have to do with the pixel page here? 

This page will come with particularities and will be related in some way to the official page of the new token.

Here you can see it, in the example.

The token will continue to exist normally, when the objectives have already been achieved.

Be among the first to buy our token
Some benefits to come, in the official token and other products, where we will give more details later.

### Why is it not published on coinmarketcap and the most famous exchanges? 

There are 2 reasons, the first reason is that our token is too new, which we do not meet some minimum requirements to list it and the second reason is the too high costs, from some exchanges that charge high fees to list a token.
